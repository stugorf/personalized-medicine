* Week 1: Intro to Personalized Medicine
** Fundamental Definitions and Concepts
*** Into
    - Vanderbilt made commitment 10 yrs ago
    - Integration into EMR
    - Sequencing and generation of genetic data is driver
    - Dr. Roden
    - Best we can given the evidence we have for each pt
    - 
    - hippocrates said more important what sort of person has a disease rather than the disease the person has
    - Osler: great physician treats the patient
    - personalized medicine has been around for very long time
    - we now have new tools to understand individual variability
    - modern computer tech allows us to analyze DNA
    - science of DNA and managing big data are two advances driving personalized medicine
      - allow us to see differnences in people
      - look for patterns in EMR, DNA, proteins
    - engage pts in their own care but they also vary in their excitment about this new knowledge
      - education, raising, culture, religion
      - access to Internet is driving pt access to medical knowledge
    - Purkinjie Caech republic discovered everyone has unique fingerprint
    - how do we transmit genetic information from one generation to another
    - 19th century Gregor Mendel discovered by breeding peas genetic system
      - phenotype is physical characteristic
      - smooth vs. crinkeled peas
    - Watson & Crick in 1950s described DNA structure
      - in a single page Nature publication won Nobel Prize
      - drawing was by his wife
      - structural biologist and suggest it may have something to do with genetic information
      - from structure, to function
      - they understood that the pairing of DNA rungs AT CG allow for mechinism of copying and passing on genetic information
      - unwinding results of copies that can duplicate original structure
*** Genetics Definitions Part I
    - DNA is long molecule, organized in nucleus of cell and wound into centromeres and those form chromosomes
    - 22 pairs of chromosomes (autosomes) and 1 pair of sex chromosomes for 23 totals
    - longest is 1st pair and smallest is 22
    - gamete cells only have half of each chromosome (random)
    - Y chromosome always from his father's line
      - track lineage
    - maternal line of DNA is in mitochondria
      - mitochondrial DNA
      - from cytoplasm of egg cell which has mitochondria
    - central dogma of genetics
      - genetic info encoded in DNA
      - can be copied
      - can make single strand called RNA
	- has same four bases but T becomes U but are similar
	- template for making proteins
	  - hair, liver functions, heart functions, etc...
	  - proteins made of blocks of 20 amino acids
    - Protein
      - gene's encode protein but most DNA is non-coding
      - most DNA is regulatory for the 1% that encodes proteins
      - specific regions, promoter regions that allow RNA polymerase to bind
      - RNA exported from nuclease (messenger RNA) into cytoplasm which encodes protien
      - gene can be very long structure but out of 100s of thousands of base pairs only a 1000 may be encoding
      - variation in non-coding regions may affect mRNA expression but not protein coding sequence
      - DNA -> mRNA -> exons and introns (introns are larger)
      - splicing deletes intronic material
      - splicing cannot also result in different exon sequences
      - one gene can encode different proteins
      - ribosome attaches to mRNA and 3 letter codon
      - each codon encodes a amino acid
      - each RNA translates into unique protein where ribosome is processsor of process
      - 64 different combinations of codons with redundancy make all amino acids
      - redundancy allows for DNA change but still result in same proteins
      - proteins assume alpha helix or beta pleated sheet
      - proteins can bind and becom multi protein complex that then acheives functionality of proteins
      - for example in liver cell some genes are activated, expressed to provide functionality
      - when changes in DNA like a deletion of sequence may result in different proteins or complexes which can result in disease or reaction to drugs
      - common form of variation is in single base pair which can change an amino acid which may or may not result in a signifiant change.
*** Genetics Definitions Part II & Types of Genetic Variants
    - 247 million base pairs, 2,825 genes in chromosome 1
    - 3 billion base pairs, 25,000 genes in total. 6 billion total in each cell
    - variation occurs at single DNA nucleotide paris and some at chromosome
    - genomes are entire genetic structure for organism
    - dog and chimp similar to human
    - mammoth DNA is available and could be used to make one
    - our current DNA has streches of neanderthal DNAz
    - chromosome come in pairs
    - in chromosome 21 a third chromosome causes cardiac and neurological disfunction
    - also at chromosome level at 9 and 22 an extra tail section is swapped at each and chromosome 22 gets Philadelphia chromosome casuses CML
    - translocations, substitutions, duplications, deletions, inversions
    - a lot of variation occurs at single base pair that is hard to visualize
    - non-coding can still affect gene regulation
    - single change base pair and single amino acid which is a single nucliotide polymorphism...or a SNP (snip)
    - truncated protein can result in nonsense mutation which is non functional
    - one base pair insertion can throw off protein that has different sequence and can result in abnormal function
    - SNP types that are present in regions of DNA that encode genes (exome) can have impact on phenotype are: missense, non-sense, frameshift and synonymous varianat
    - variations are not necessarilary a cause of disease, we do not have enough information yet to fully know
    - rare polymorphisims not always cause a disease
    - Familial hyper cholesteremia caused by single nucleotide
    - marphan's syndrome also single nucleotide polymorphism caused
    - cystic fibrosis and sickel cell caused by polymorphism of single nucleotide
*** Data Analysis Part I
    - garbage in garbage out
    - data must be high quality
    - insure high quality goes into system
    - can test data quality by doing randomized clinical trial to test drug or intervention
    - must make sure that both populations in a control or test group are the same in all dimensions other than test
    - assigning to a group should be random or from a natural seggregation
    - all other comorbidities should be same
    - odd ratios or relative risk
      - odds are division of those with trait over total
      - then compare odds or risk of each group by dividing
    - P value is what is the propbability
      - think of dice example
      - two dice is P = 1/6 squared
    - multiple comparisons can introduce error in analysis
   
*** Data Analysis Part II
    -  - evaluating how good new test are
      - reference test is the standard
      - new test examined to work better
      - for example measure serum BMP for heart attack
    - use clinical factors to predict disease
    - both new and reference have true positive and true negative
    - new test has type I error of false positive
    - new test will have fasle negative rate
    - evaluate new test using sensitivity = true positives/true negative
    - true negative / false positive = specificity
    - true postives to false positive realted to population
      - reciever operator curve
      - sensitivity over specificity results in area under curve
    - AUC of 0.7 is good but .95 is great
** Drug Actions and Reactions
*** Drug Therapy and General Mechanisms Underlying Variability in Drug Response
    - 2012 stats
      - US 3 trillion dollars on healthcare with most to hosp and professional
      - 10% to drugs
    - randomized trial creates control and comparison group
    - comparitor tx may be sugar placebo or standard tx
    - in some cases some trials do not have a clear result
    - tx, and results have to consider side effects
    - choice often depends on seriouness of disease and side effects
    - rare side effects
      - angiedema from ACE inhibitors: swelling of throat and tongue
      - hemolytic anemia: destruction of red blood cells from malaria tx
    - intracerebral hemorrhage: due to blood thinging meds
    - myositis: from statins for hyperlipidemia of high LDL
    - 1994 estimates
      - 2.2 millionin hosp
      - rare per physician but important for hosp
      - 106,000 deaths from ADE 6th leading cause of death
      - resulted in To err is Human report
    - 2010 report from state of SC shows still exist
    - 300 deaths per day in US
    - should be a question for each patient rather than population
*** Variability in Drug Therapy 
    - we see variable responses to drugs by pt and pop
    - age, sex, ancestory can cause variability
    - must always ask was dx correct
    - drug interactions
    - environment
      - diet
    - did pt taking med: some estimates are 50% do not take appropriately
      - 25% not take at all
    - did pt get med/drug as perscribed
    - a common LDL statin in african american showed 41% decrease in LDL after 6 weeks
      - some had less and some had up to 80% response
    - drug response is seldom 100%
    - sometimes as low as 30%
    - sometimes drug can work better than expected: ex blood thinners
    - sometime off target reaction is not what was expected
    - background event side effect (like Vioxx) is hard to determine cause
    - Molecular mechanism of action
      - G protein receptors
      - hormone couples to receptor and changes protein which signals cells to change release of a chemical for example
    - we have drugs that bind receptors to stop G-protein coupled receptors
      - very common target
      - dose, plasma distribution, elimination, tissue absorption
    - once a drug is in plasma the molecular target is next step
    - must access molecular site of action to produce it's effect
    - one source of variability can be other drugs that affect binding, is dx right, genetic variance of target; organ function
    - placebo effect
      - give pts drugs with suggested response and they will have it
*** Drug Metabolism & Transport
    - CYP2C Phase I site of enzymatic action
      - CYP3A4/5/7 most important
    - decreased drug absorption can result in high levels
    - Van Gogh painted his doctor with foxglove: Dr. Gachet
    - high dig causes yellow halos visually and his doctor may have given him too high digoxin levels
    - dig is not metabolized and is excreted in bile unchanged
    - dig is moved from one side of cell membrane via cell transport
    - drug transport molecules can move drug into cells or into system from cell
    - MDR1 encodes P-glycoprotein is a drug transporter for dig
